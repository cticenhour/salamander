# PICStudyBase

A base class for the PIC simulations utilizing the RayTracing module. The base study only registers basic ray data needed for PIC and provides a basic implementation of `postExecuteStudy()` which moves `bankedRay()` to a public member variable `_banked_rays`. `RayDataIndex`'s are registered for each velocity component. Each is named registered with the name `"v_n"` and corrisponding member variable `_v_n_index` where  `n` is one of the following x, y or z. An additional `RayDataIndex` called `_direction_set_index` with the name `"direction_set"` which stores a flag that should be checked in the RayKernel which sets the direction and maximum distance in the `preTrace()` method so the kernel does not try to set the starting directiond and maximum distance when a `Ray` is passed between processors.
