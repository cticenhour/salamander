Verification, validation, and example cases list cases showcasing SALAMANDER's capabilities and ensuring its accuracy.

For [software quality assurance](content/sqa/index.md) purposes, SALAMANDER undergoes verification and validation.
Verification consists of comparing SALAMANDER predictions against analytical solutions in different conditions, which are often simple cases.
Validation consists of comparing SALAMANDER predictions against experimental data.

Note that in addition to monitoring SALAMANDER performance and reproducibility in verification and validation cases, the effects of changes made to SALAMANDER are tracked. A series of automated tests are performed via continuous integration using [CIVET](https://civet.inl.gov/repo/1108) to help identify any changes in SALAMANDER's predictions, therefore ensuring stability and robustness.

Benchmarking cases compare SALAMANDER predictions against other codes. Example cases showcase existing SALAMANDER capabilities and demonstrate potential applications.

In all cases, the existing input files should allow users to leverage prior work.

Finally, for more references of SALAMANDER usage, a list of publications supporting SALAMANDER development can be found [here](publications.md).

Note that codes couples with SALAMANDER, such as [TMAP8](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/tmap8), have their own [Verification and Validation page](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/tmap8/verification_and_validation).
